    <h3>The plan:</h3>
        <div class = "main-content">
      <ul> 
        <li>I started out by looking into the MIDI file format and finding out ways to parse the file</li>
        <li>I discovered that java comes with a default sound library, which includes methods to work with synthesizers and MIDI events and file reading</li>
        <li>Using this, I began to work on a rudimentary MIDI file parser, looking to read basic MIDI note events (No MIDI CC's yet) and converting and storing the data to a format I find more usable. (Which I will call SoundProcesses</li>
        <li>I also began looking into implentations with the BukkitAPI, allowing me to create a rudimentary sound player which is still WIP. I'm currently working on improving the soundMapper which will map certain notes to certain samples which will play the sound back in tune. </li>
