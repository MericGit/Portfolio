    <h3>The plan:</h3>
        <div class = "main-content">
      <ul> 
        <li>I started out by looking into the MIDI file format and finding out ways to parse the file</li>
        <li>I discovered that java comes with a default sound library, which includes methods to work with synthesizers and MIDI events and file reading</li>
        <li>Using this, I began to work on a rudimentary MIDI file parser</li>
        <li> I also began to look into the BukkitAPI in order for me to actually playback files in MC. Eventually I'll look into other sound libraries in order to render out an audio mixdown file as well, but that's a task for another day </li>
     </ul>
