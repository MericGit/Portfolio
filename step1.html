    <h3>The plan:</h3>
        <div class = "main-content">
      <ul> 
        <li>I started the project a few weeks ago in the beginning of september. After working with ONBS (A musical application primarily made for creating noteblock music in MC) I wanted to create a more robust, useful application for NBS music with custom samples.</li>
        <li>The goal was to create an app that could take a MIDI file and automatically parse the file to map custom samples to the file.</li>
        <li>The final goal is the integration of the traditional DAW and NBS, allowing people to compose in a DAW and get their playback as a SoundProcess (A simplified MIDI File with audio included)</li>
        <li> Armed with this goal, I began looking into ways I could make this possible. I wanted to dedicate some time to research the MIDI file format, and the bukkit API to learn how to create my dream app.</li>
